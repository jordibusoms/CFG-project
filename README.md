Comparative and Functional Genomics <br />
**Authors: Mariana Quiroga & Jordi Busoms** <br />


The project focus on the functional characterization of unknown proteins using different tools based on comparative genomics and differential gene expression.<br />

-`sequences.txt`contains 10 unknown proteins.
-`get_orthologs.py`contains a `Python` code that allows to find ortholog sequences in a database given by the teacher. We used `Biopython`to parse fasta format to find them. <br />
